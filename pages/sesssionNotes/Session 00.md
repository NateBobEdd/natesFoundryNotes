## Ship-to-Ship Combat

Is this something you would like to engage with, as the current Spelljammer rules are very light on how to actually do combat, actually encouraging you to just get as close as possible to board the enemy ships.

## Backstory

Hand out questions for players to answer backstory and inspire: [[Character Backstory Template]]

While creating your backstory flesh out your village, town or city. Give it a name, Give it life. This is your time to create part of the world. So during the adventure you can drop lore about your town that effects the world.
